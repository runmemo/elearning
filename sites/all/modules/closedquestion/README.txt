-- SUMMARY --

The Drupal module ClosedQuestion adds the Closed Question node-type to Drupal
that takes an XML question definition and displays this question to users.
The ClosedQuestion-nodes are stand-alone and can be used anywhere a normal node
is used.

Features
 * Designed for practice: students can take as many attempts as they like.
 * Many feedback options, feedback can change with attempts.
 * Many question types.
 * Questions can be used anywhere.

Comparison with Quiz
Quiz is made for quizzes. This makes Quiz mainly suitable for testing knowledge,
less for learning. Quiz has:
 * One try per question.
 * Very limited feedback.
 * Limited number of question types.
 * Questions do not work outside of a quiz.


-- REQUIREMENTS --

ClosedQuestion needs php DOM support. On Redhat systems you will have to install
the package php-xml. Try:  yum install php-xml

ClosedQuestion depends on the libraries module.

Recommended are:
 * advanced_help for getting all the documentation.
   http://drupal.org/project/advanced_help

-- INSTALLATION --

* Install as usual, see http://drupal.org/node/70151 for further information.

* Create an input format for ClosedQuestion nodes.

* Turn the "Line break converter" rule _off_ for this input format.

  - sites/all/libraries/jquery-json/jquery.json.js
  - sites/all/libraries/jquery-json/jquery.json.min.js

* Put jquery.jstree  in sites/all/libraries/jquery-jstree

-- DESIGN --

A QlosedQuestion node is a fully self-contained question that can be answered by
a user just as it is.

During node_load an object of type CqQuestionInterface is added as
  $node->question

During node_view $node->question->getOutput() is called, which returns a
complete Drupal form containing the question.

The submit handler for this form is
  closedquestion_submit_answer($form, &$form_state)
which redirects to
  $node->question->submitAnswer($form, $form_state);

If an external object like a ProteusQuiz node or LinearCase node wants to track
the progress of the user, it has several options:
 * Add a listener to the $node->question. This listener is called when the user
   answers the question correctly for the first time and whenever the question
   generates feedback.
 * Call isCorrect(), onceCorrect(), getTries() on $node->question.
 * Look at $node->question->getAnswer(), which returns a CqUserAnswer object
   that contains the answer of the user.
